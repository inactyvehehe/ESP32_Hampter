# ESP32_Hampter_V.A01
Hobby project. I am trying to create a multipurpose device using ESP32
(mainly just to test my capabilities with using a variety of modules as well as exploring the ability to use bus connections)

Connection diagram will be uploaded in future versions when it is sufficiently functional (probably after keyboard, battery and RF function is implemented)
