# ESP32_Hampter_V.A02
Hobby project. I am trying to create a multipurpose device using ESP32
(mainly just to test my capabilities with using a variety of modules as well as exploring coding and optimization)

Connection diagram will be uploaded in future versions when it is sufficiently functional (probably after keyboard, battery and RF function is implemented)

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Separate versions are created mainly to archive progress, they can be accessed through their respective folders
