I will be returning to this project very soon.

my computer got hacked, an unpublished version (VA04) was purged along with the rest of my data just in case.
I will be picking up where I left off in VA03

the new variant of VA04 will attempt to integrate a crypto ledger, I barely know anything about crypto and ledgers, therefore I will be taking my time understanding how they work as well as how encryption works for added security.
If possible I will try to encrypt the entire code in my esp32
